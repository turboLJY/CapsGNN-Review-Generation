# Datasets
Our review datasets, including Amazon Book, Electronic and IMDB movie, can be downloaded from [Amazon Review](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html) and crawled from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). In addition, the entity-item linkage can be accessed from [KB4Rec](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/KB4Rec). Note that, to crawl the IMDB review, we first take the linked items in KB4Rec as spider seeds, and then crawl their corresponding review text. Finally, the review text (labelled with entities) in three domains can be downloaded through [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xvAkWs8JXKRigMH68mK2zbhoqzvfcvou?usp=sharing). The following table presents the statistics of our datasets after preprocessing.

| Datasets  | | Electronic | Book | Movie |
|:----:|:----|---------:|----:|----:|
|           | #Users     | 46,086 | 61,722 |  46,893  | 
|   Review  | #Items     | 11,216 | 19,129 |  21,023   |
|           | #Reviews   | 199,617 | 731,800 | 1,149,294 |
|           | #Entities  | 30,301  | 96,173 | 594,452 |
|   KG      | #Relations | 20      | 12 | 22 |
|           | #Triples   | 68,620  | 285,118 | 2,130,368 |

Note that, the #Entities includes the aligned entities and its one-hop entities (neighbors), the #Relations includes the forward and backward relations, and the #Triples removes the triples with ''name'' and ''description'' relations. The following table demonstrates the included forward relations.

| Datasets | Relations |
|:----:|:---------|
|  Electronic  | computer_peripheral, product_line, category, manufacturer, ad_campaigns, digital_camera_manufacturer, developer, brand, supported_storage_types, industry  | 
| Book | genre, subject, author, edition, character, language |
| Movie | genre, actor, director, writer, producer, music, country, language |

# Training Instructions

Before implement our code, you need to prepare the following dictionaries related to review text:

```
context.pkl and context_rev.pkl: the mapping from context into idx, and vice versa (e.g., Item_IDxxx -> 1010, 1010 -> Item_IDxxx).
aspect.pkl and aspect_rev.pkl: the mapping from aspects into idx, and vice versa (e.g., director -> 3, 3 -> director).
token.pkl and token_rev.pkl: the mapping from tokens into idx, and vice versa (e.g., Tim_burton -> 199, 199 -> Tim_burton).
```

and following dictionaries related to knowledge graph:

```
node.pkl and node_rev.pkl: the mapping from graph nodes into idx, and vice versa (e.g., m.01758 -> 435, 435 -> m.01758).
relation.pkl and relation_rev.pkl: the mapping from graph relations into idx, and vice versa (e.g., film.director.film -> 10, 10 -> film.director.film).
node_2_neighbor.pkl: the mapping from graph nodes into their one-hop neighbors.
node_2_name.pkl: the mapping from graph nodes into their names.
user_item_graph.pkl: the mapping from (user, item) pair to their heterogeneous KG, and the HKG is organized as Pytorch geometric structure.
```

After preparing all the dictionaries, you can run the run.sh file in aspect and review directories to train the two modules, respectively. 

```
sh run.sh
```

# Testing Instructions

At the test stage, you should (only) run the run.sh file in review directories to test the generation performance of our model.
